              <p> The caravan of the &#8220;Diamond Ace&#8221; is one of the most terrifying 
                events that happened in the country for the last fifty years. 
                Unofficial investigation data has it that the caravan was to blame 
                for the disappearance of over one hundred young people. Of sixteen 
                murders the caravan was accused and found guilty, and there is 
                suspicion of them being the weapon for carrying out another thirty 
                four murders. This hellish team floated to the surface somewhere 
                on the outskirts of the Tarunian area and traveled for four hundred 
                kilometers down the middle of our country, taking lives as they 
                went. Some people were killed and many disappeared never to be 
                seen again. The strategists of the governmental secret services 
                made several mistakes for some unknown reason and the Caravan 
                managed to escape a number of times, just to appear somewhere 
                else spontaneously. It was on September the 14th that the Caravan 
                was caught and massacred near Orv.</p>

            <blockquote> 
              <p> The position of the Keeper of the Cemetery has been passed on 
                for over three generations now, however there is no information 
                as for its being caste or ritual. Since the foundation of the 
                stone city, the cemetery was kept by quite a number of people 
                and among them there were not only ones from the steppe. Our contemporary 
                keeper is actually of the late settlers, so it would be foolish 
                to attempt explaining the strange behavior of the keepers by attributing 
                it to their being members of the local death cult. In fact, people 
                of the steppe don&#8217;t actually have a fully developed death cult; 
                it is in some way integrated into the complicated cult of the 
                earth. The inhabitants of the steppe are afraid of their dead 
                and take them for filth. The custom of burying the dead by means 
                of putting them inside the earth they think for barbarism and 
                only the chosen ones, the most revered of their people are allowed 
                to be buried in this way. Moreover, occasions of such &#8220;filthy&#8221; 
                burial are accompanied by numerous rituals of cleansing.</p>

                Council decided to go on with the project.<br>
                <br>
                This decision was inspired by the rate of development of our country 
                and the promising results of the geological survey. The scarce 
                settlements of this area, most of which were built in the previous 
                century, are basically cattle-dealing factories, and few of them 
                became small towns. Theses towns&#8217; inhabitants are a society that 
                is quite unusual and paradoxically pretentious. Manufacturers, 
                ethnographers, inspectors, anthropologists, descendants of the 
                political outcasts and random visitors &#8211; all in all educated people 
                &#8211; managed to peacefully coexist with the native inhabitants of 
                the area, whose traditions haven&#8217;t gone far from the archaic social 
                system. </p>

                steppe inhabitants, who understood the howling of their bulls
