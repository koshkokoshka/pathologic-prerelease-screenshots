              of the Caravan</span></p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p> The caravan of the &#8220;Diamond Ace&#8221; is one of the most terrifying 
                events that happened in the country for the last fifty years. 
                Unofficial investigation data has it that the caravan was to blame 
                for the disappearance of over one hundred young people. Of sixteen 
                murders the caravan was accused and found guilty, and there is 
                suspicion of them being the weapon for carrying out another thirty 
                four murders. This hellish team floated to the surface somewhere 
                on the outskirts of the Tarunian area and traveled for four hundred 
                kilometers down the middle of our country, taking lives as they 
                went. Some people were killed and many disappeared never to be 
                seen again. The strategists of the governmental secret services 
                made several mistakes for some unknown reason and the Caravan 
                managed to escape a number of times, just to appear somewhere 
                else spontaneously. It was on September the 14th that the Caravan 
                was caught and massacred near Orv.<br>
                <br>
                What was really so horrible about the Caravan (or the &#8220;Family 
                of the Diamond Ace&#8221; as they called themselves)? If we were to 
                compile all the rumors and doubtful reports, we could imagine 
                that they were either some vile demons or death cultists. &#8220;The 
                Pointless Diversion of Hell&#8221;, &#8220;The Clockwork Scarecrows&#8221;, &#8220;The 
                Scrappy Cannibals&#8221; &#8211; such nicknames and bold headlines provoked 
                the nonsense of the rumors. Reality, in fact, was more prosaic, 
                but no less horrible. Apparently, it was quite a large (500 creatures, 
                600 with figurines according to some sources) roaming circus.<br>
                <br>
                They left no one handsome or talented child anywhere they went. 
                Their method was as follows: having arrived in some settlement 
                (always at night, just before dawn), they would put their carts 
                in a circle, make camps and some disintegrating stage; in the 
                morning, they would make a performance for children: female singers&#8217; 
                songs, the clown jokes, the somersaulting dogs, cats that could 
                guess numbers and master gymnasts &#8211; all these were present. However, 
                while the children were watching the performance, they were being 
                watched from behind the scrappy curtains by dozens of keen eyes. 
                They were out to spot the pretty, the talented, and these eyes 
                would remember them.<br>
                <br>
                After the morning performance, the happy children would return 
                home and sleep happily in their cozy beds, dreaming about circus 
                life and tomorrow&#8217;s performance. Meanwhile the settlement would 
                be bustling about the forbidden circus program &#8211; the &#8220;Macabre 
                Theatre&#8221;, and of course the town would go and see it. Ones that 
                came at night would see the circus opening different carts to 
                the ones they opened in the morning and they would be shown just 
                the same tricks that were for the children, but always with a 
                touch of lechery and cruelty. Moreover, they had freaks that they 
                called &#8220;figurines&#8221; and would secretly exhibit in a separate pavilion 
                for a separate price.<br>
                <br>
                While the adults were watching the show, the acrobats of the circus 
                would kidnap the children noticed during the day and leave behind 
                freaks instead. The stolen children were integrated into the satanic 
                system of the caravan to become all sorts of artists, athletes, 
                clowns and prostitutes. Along with the children they would take 
                the belongings of their parents. The acrobats were often accompanied 
                by heavyweights and strong men, so that in case some parents didn&#8217;t 
                go to see the show, they would be tortured and killed.<br>
                <br>
                The reprisal against the caravan was terrible. The punishing measures 
                taken were unparalleled in roughness for our humanist time. The 
                population, however, having been warmed up by all sorts of slogans 
                and theme publications, was rejoicing. It was the first time that 
                the people were prepared to praise the authorities and establish 
                granite monuments in memory of secret service generals. The gymnasts, 
                heavyweights, animal trainers along with the animals and the innocent 
                freaks were killed instantly. The directors of the caravan were 
                taken prisoner for interrogation, but they behaved at the interrogation 
                sessions in just the same way they did on stage, so they became 
                subject to awful torture and beating. Many of the clowns didn&#8217;t 
                live to see the trial. Any who survived were given the death penalty.<br>
                <br>
                After that there was a whole wave of repression against free artistry 
                &#8211; those inspired by the government and ones performed by the people. 
                Many innocent people suffered. Many had to leave their risky profession 
                and conceal their past. For a few years free artistry was declared 
                out of the law and driven underground. Even the innocent tricks 
                with juggling became forbidden entertainment, being a reminiscence 
                of the dark events.<br>
                <br>
                Any interest for talented children aroused suspicion; as the interrogations 
                showed, the interest for them of the Family of the Diamond Ace 
                was absolutely pathologic &#8211; they couldn&#8217;t conceal this passion 
                even being threatened with death. Perhaps Anna Heart, (nicknamed 
                Anna Angel) who arrived in the town not long ago, has nothing 
                to do with the Caravan, but when she came, she settled with some 
                orphan girl named Vera Verbah, whose father died during the war 
                and the mother died during the first outbreak of the plague. Vera 
                took her in, welcomed her in her lonesome house, but soon after, 
                she disappeared. Now she&#8217;s gone and Anna lives in her house and 
                wears her hair. Why would she need false hair? And others too&#8230; 
                sometimes they act as if they fear the revelation of their secrets.<br>
                <br>
                All this is loathsome forgery, lie and hypocrisy! How is it that 
                everyone pretending to be someone else, why is nobody daring to 
                say the truth about themselves? Substituted children, deceived 
                audience, names, forever forgotten&#8230; Stolen actors put on vivid 
                masks play other people&#8217;s roles, playing with the puppet threads 
                without even the shade of embarrassment! Sham and plaster casts 
                are everywhere, mirage instead of truth &#8211; how do we fight this? 
                How do we live with this now?</p>
