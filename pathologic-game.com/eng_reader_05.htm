              Keeper of the Cemetery</span></p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p> The position of the Keeper of the Cemetery has been passed on 
                for over three generations now, however there is no information 
                as for its being caste or ritual. Since the foundation of the 
                stone city, the cemetery was kept by quite a number of people 
                and among them there were not only ones from the steppe. Our contemporary 
                keeper is actually of the late settlers, so it would be foolish 
                to attempt explaining the strange behavior of the keepers by attributing 
                it to their being members of the local death cult. In fact, people 
                of the steppe don&#8217;t actually have a fully developed death cult; 
                it is in some way integrated into the complicated cult of the 
                earth. The inhabitants of the steppe are afraid of their dead 
                and take them for filth. The custom of burying the dead by means 
                of putting them inside the earth they think for barbarism and 
                only the chosen ones, the most revered of their people are allowed 
                to be buried in this way. Moreover, occasions of such &#8220;filthy&#8221; 
                burial are accompanied by numerous rituals of cleansing.</p>
              <p>Some primitive peoples look upon their dead just as if they were 
                living. Their mythology didn&#8217;t create a world where the dead could 
                live or await the meeting with the living. Not having the ability 
                to preserve the voices and feelings of the dead and not believing 
                in the forthcoming meeting with the beloved ancestors, these peoples 
                try to save the bones of their dead and give them the attributes 
                of the person. In this way they create an illusion of the person&#8217;s 
                presence in everyday life. Our steppe people are not of this kind.</p>
              <p>I presume that the strange care and warmth with which our keeper 
                treats the dead has nothing to do with ritual or tradition. The 
                desire to care for the dead, to comfort them in the way he does 
                it, comes from the depth of the human soul. The keeper treats 
                the dead in this way because he sees no alternative. It is barely 
                possible that he loves the dead, but I&#8217;m sure he feels them too 
                well to treat them with indifference.</p>
              <p>I think that the reason for such whole-hearted attention to the 
                dead comes from exceeding usage of twyrin and smoking the resinous 
                roots of saviur. There is no other explanation because the keeper 
                is no madman, in fact, he is quite a sensible person. Twyrin sharpened 
                his senses. By exceeding the allowed dosage of twyrin, living 
                in a scarcely populated area of the town, among the wide variety 
                of herbs, the keeper learnt of the torment of the dead too many 
                things that mortal men aren&#8217;t allowed to know. He can feel the 
                awful, hopeless pain of the dead with his skin, his nerves, and 
                therefore, he tries to ease it by feeding them sugar and pouring 
                warm milk on the graves. I think that their pain spread on him 
                shocked the man. He tries to ease his own pain by drinking more 
                twyrin, but his senses sharpen even more and the torment becomes 
                overwhelming.</p>
              <p>He brought up his daughter, Laska, in this way. First, he made 
                his wife drink as much twyrin, then did the same to her. The baneful 
                influence of the herbs had an effect on his family members. Their 
                ears are extremely sensitive and the hairs on their skin seem 
                to move in response to any stirring on the cemetery land. His 
                wife used to be a pretty woman in her youth, but later turned 
                into something that looked like a creature from the other side. 
                By the time her hair went gray, she had grown it to be so dense 
                and heavy, as to conceal her whole body. If one were to look at 
                her from behind, her hair reached the ground and fell lower than 
                her waist from the front. Her nails became stone-hard and the 
                skin on her hands became dry and wrinkly because of the constant 
                digging that she was up to.</p>
              <p>Obviously, the family cannot treat the dead for anything other 
                than their relatives, perhaps immobile, but present at all times. 
                The three live and sleep almost hugging the dead. The earth, full 
                of buried people lulls them on its dented hand; at night, when 
                the silent aura of the town isn&#8217;t broken by any foreign sounds, 
                they press their ears against their rough beds, their blood full 
                of the hallucinating twyrin, and listen to the sounds of the earth; 
                stars shed their cold light from above upon them, staring indifferently 
                at the three. The dead are everywhere around them, their tormented 
                screams and groans louder and louder. Sometimes, having just buried 
                a man in the morning, by the time dusk sets in, they hear the 
                stirring and discomfort of the new neighbor.</p>
              <p>Being able to hear the speech of the dead and feel their pain, 
                the keeper can no longer forget about his ward. He cares about 
                them because feels with every molecule of his body that their 
                existence is not over. Perhaps he no longer thinks that this care 
                is utmost necessity, but takes it for an unpleasant, but essential 
                duty.</p>

              of soothing drugs to some of the infected, if the disease seemed
