            <blockquote> 
              <p> When Nina Kain ruled the town, the people, who weren&#8217;t used 
                to monarchy and even more so to pristine magic, watched with awe 
                and fear how a demonic queen can rule. It seemed that a figure 
                of a divine woman with a sweeping wave of dark hair is soaring 
                in the sky, her exquisite features wrapped in clouds; she seemed 
                to be a massive monument of an ancient sovereign. They said she 
                was almighty. They said that at night, in her true form, &#8211; her 
                head touching the sky, her figure slim and lithe as an ivy branch 
                and as the lightning, &#8211; she walks around town, lightly moving 
                her pale shoulders, and takes what is hers, but gives with godly 
                generosity what otherwise mortal men could have under no circumstances.</p>
              <p>That&#8217;s what they used to say and that&#8217;s what they say today. 
                Now that it has been fifteen years since her death and her biography 
                is history and legend, it is worth looking at Nina&#8217;s image and 
                separate the truth from fiction.</p>
              <p>First of all, the truth is that during the short period of her 
                rule, Nina managed to shake both souls and minds of people who 
                weren&#8217;t at all inclined for reasonless exaltation. The truth was 
                that she was indescribably beautiful &#8211; even the most captious 
                judge would find her appearance both perfect and demonic. Imperious 
                gestures of her delicate hands, milk-white skin, pitch-black eyes, 
                majestic deportment and iniquitous forms of her bitten lips. The 
                truth is that the people&#8217;s memory gave her such features that 
                both refined tyrants and enlightened emperors would love to have.</p>
              <p>However, the most interesting thing is that everyone called her 
                a witch despite the fact that she never demonstrated some supernatural 
                deed, not once. In fact, she actually didn&#8217;t have any &#8220;special&#8221; 
                abilities. She couldn&#8217;t throw lightning, nor could she do any 
                tricks, nor stop enemy legions by means of gesture, nor transform 
                lead into gold. But what really was? The masses&#8217; memory is the 
                most sober historical source; it cannot be cheated or bribed by 
                planned falsifications. What happened?</p>
              <p>This woman emanated this special sort of energy &#8211; the energy 
                that allowed her to create things that shouldn&#8217;t be. Next to her 
                seemed possible &#8211; and in fact were &#8211; such things that wouldn&#8217;t 
                be possible under any other circumstances. This energy was extremely 
                strong within her. It was like a fiery column that stretched from 
                her head to the sky, one could almost feel it. Being unable to 
                make this image more vivid, the people invented a legend about 
                a woman that was extremely tall, reaching the sky, and went about 
                playing with the town as if she were a child playing with toy 
                bricks. That is actually the image of the Mistress Nina on children&#8217;s 
                pictures of that time. Rapture, violent happiness and passion 
                were the feeling that filled the space where she went. That was 
                her witchery.</p>
              <p>Her nature suited that of the Kain family. The Kains have this 
                heritage of inclination for brave and dangerous experiments, impudence 
                and absence of any desire to acknowledge any laws, no matter if 
                they are the laws of physics or history; this virtue was the very 
                environment that Nina was most comfortable with. Their manner 
                of ruling by means of invisible power, regulating the directions 
                of the people&#8217;s mood, its uprises and storms, all this gave her 
                great opportunities. Nina took the town in her warm hands, squeezed 
                it into an obedient lump of clay, softened it and began shaping 
                the realm of her dreams.</p>
              <p>Meanwhile people loved her more and more! Her passion was, in 
                fact, contagious; her strict eyes burned with furious mirth, which 
                had no effect on her mimics or behavior. Nina was the kind of 
                person that is so vividly seen in Maria now: one of coldness, 
                absolute self-control and total sobriety, with the ability to 
                perform foolhardy deeds.</p>
              <p>From another source:</p>
              <p>&#8220;&#8230;The whole time that Nina was the Mistress of the Kain family, 
                she held the town in fear. Paradoxical, but that was the cause 
                for the increase of love towards the Kains, that took place lately 
                &#8211; compared to Nina, all the other members of the family looked 
                extremely humanist. Nina broke and crippled dozens of lives, families 
                broke up because of her, and houses were taken down on her command. 
                Any, who she didn&#8217;t think to be her equal weren&#8217;t worthy of taking 
                into consideration at all &#8211; people for her were some kind of ants. 
                When Nina was bored &#8211; and that was quite a frequent event &#8211; she 
                behaved as if she were Dracula, simply went around the city looking 
                for situations that could interest her and solved different things 
                according to her understanding of justice. She could easily take 
                a child from a stupid mother, give him to the Master of the Abattoir 
                for him to make a steppe scout out of the child. She could enter 
                a house and order its inhabitants to show her the most precious 
                thing they had and if the people tried to conceal the real item, 
                she would order for the liars to be dealt with. No matter how 
                strange, but the people were quite patient about this. Nina was 
                taken for a beautiful and awe-inspiring protector of the town, 
                who had to be propitiated by means of bloody sacrifice. When Nina 
                died, the inhabitants took a deep, easy breath, but continued 
                to treat her as before, in fact, even with more piety, because 
                now she obtained another quality that was added to what she already 
                had &#8211; she was dead.&#8221;</p>

            <p>&quot;Most games today are extremely monotonous, being nothing 
              more than flat copies of the real world, that boring and well-studied 
              establishment, which has more than proven its worthlessness. These 
              products are not entertaining or creative and don&#8217;t offer a fantastic 
              counterforce for reality. Few are those people that can make some 
              new, bold and interesting visuals; those who have the talent and 
              experience though, are usually crushed or under immense pressure 
              that comes from their far more primitive contemporaries. We didn&#8217;t 
              set before us the task of copying reality in all its detail, when 
              making this game. We were trying to make an unusual, highly artistic 
              world, therefore when I created the exterior of the locations and 
              textures, my primary goal was to surprise and show the gamers unique, 
              beautiful and mysterious places, which they will never find anywhere 
              else in the world.&quot;</p>
