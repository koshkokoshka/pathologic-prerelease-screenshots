            <blockquote> 
              <p> &#8230;I should check my state before exiting the house. Each new 
                day brings different unpleasant surprises, ok, so how is it?<br>
                <br>
                Exhaustion, well I don&#8217;t feel too tired, had a good sleep. If 
                I don&#8217;t overexert myself, I&#8217;ll be able to exist without sleep 
                for 16 hours, that&#8217;s quite a lot.<br>
                <br>
                I feel pretty hungry, though. I didn&#8217;t go into any infected houses 
                yesterday and had a fight with the marauders. I don&#8217;t have the 
                money to buy any food. So what do we have, I am hungry and have 
                no food. I&#8217;ll have to see what I can do about that as soon as 
                possible.<br>
                <br>
                How about my reputation? Yeah&#8230; that&#8217;s the problem. That&#8217;s why 
                I&#8217;ve no money. The lust for vengeance, natural cruelty, love for 
                marauding and the incidental encounters with these hysterical 
                infected, whom I decide to kill immediately have had their consequences. 
                It&#8217;s becoming harder and harder to get my hands on money. Even 
                responsible people are giving me small sums. I must restore my 
                good name.<br>
                <br>
                Now&#8230; let&#8217;s take a look at what I do have.<br>
                <br>
                Immunity stimulators &#8211; none! Level of immunity is but nothing. 
                That is awful, if my district has been infected over the night, 
                only a miracle could save me. I do have some cheap and dangerous 
                painkillers in store though. They could help me restore my reputation, 
                if I were to give them to the infected, but nearing these people 
                barely any immunity is no good either&#8230; The situation couldn&#8217;t 
                be worse.<br>
                Any special clothes? Yep, I have some stalking boots, and a concealing 
                cloak, but no repellants at all! Ok, the clothes I have gives 
                me a chance to make a successful raid at the locked up areas.<br>
                How about weaponry? Alright, I&#8217;ve a shotgun and one bullet for 
                it, one, but it kills anyone at close distance. Moreover, I&#8217;ve 
                a revolver and a whole charger for it, two bullets left in the 
                weapon since yesterday.<br>
                <br>
                Right, so here&#8217;s the plan for the morning: run to the locked up 
                area, kill a few marauders, and take the things they stole from 
                them, check out a few locked up houses on my way back &#8211; what they 
                have in store. Then use the money gained from this to buy some 
                immunity stimulators and begin restoring my reputation. Then, 
                perhaps, I could go and start communicating with the citizens&#8230;<br>

                never mind&#8230;<br>
                <br>
                How is the weather? Hmmm, not too good: gray autumn sky, dim light 
                and empty passages between the rusting warehouses. There are rats 
                here and there, cuddled up in the darker corners and dying. The 
                trees are shedding their dry leaves. The steppe air is as dense 
                as resin, I can feel it with my lungs, only if I could see it 
                with my eyes&#8230; could make an interesting experiment. Damn! Where 
                did that come from, right I was, if only I could see it with my 
                eyes, I would have seen the wind that&#8217;s flung all this rubbish 
                in my face&#8230; Huh? I feel a bit dizzy&#8230; It can&#8217;t be! There must have 
                been particles of the plague in that, I&#8217;m feeling faint&#8230; must 
                be ill. It&#8217;s probably the end of me, damn, why didn&#8217;t I check 
                my state before exiting the dissecting room, my immunity level 
                is barely anything! I could try and survive on the antibiotics 
                and try to destroy the disease with chemicals, but there are too 
                few, and I spent all my money on weaponry yesterday&#8230; oh&#8230;<br>
                <br>
                (The bachelor faints and begins struggling to keep his soul within 
                his body, but fails.)<br>
                <br>
                How strange, looking down at my body&#8230; just a second of thoughtlessness 
                cost me my life. If only the air had been more densely littered, 
                I could have seen the coming infection and returned to the dissecting 
                room just in time to equip myself appropriately. Couldn&#8217;t do it&#8230;<br>

            <ul>
              <li> The game &#8220;Pathologic&#8221; was created to give a new 
                view of the battle between man and evil. The Evil in this game 
                is real. It seems we have succeeded in depicting its true form 
                and insert it into the game mechanics. Such games are dangerous 
                and this is our official preliminary warning.<br>
                <br>
              </li>
              <li>The world of the game is a stone town on the border. Every house, 
                every tiny fragment of the town resembles its prototype. If we 
                throw out the useless pathetic, we&#8217;ll have a town that&#8217;s 
                not been invented, it&#8217;s been rebuilt. Every day we have 
                more and more things that are in their right place.<br>
                <br>
              </li>
              <li>After some work with live actors, there are 27 characters in 
                &#8220;Pathologic.&#8221; The players will be able to see photos 
                of real people in the game, a part of which is concealed behind 
                the masks of 3D dolls.<br>
                <br>
              </li>
              <li> Every courtyard of the game lives its own inner life. Often 
                random factors and planned events occur independently from where 
                the player is what his state is. It can be different, however.<br>
                <br>
              </li>
              <li>The primary task in the game is survival. The game allows the 
                player to choose his personal strategy for survival &#8211; whatever 
                you like. Chaos, marauding, communication, sleep, speculation, 
                fighting or other&#8230; The freedom is restricted only by the 
                abilities of the person and his will, as it is in life.<br>
                <br>
              </li>
              <li>Each of the characters lives the 12 days in his own personal 
                way and will unveil the story only from one side. Each will see 
                the same things, but will come to his own conclusions.<br>
                <br>
              </li>
              <li>The essence of the game is a trap. Every one of the possible 
                finals could be either victory or defeat.<br>
                <br>
